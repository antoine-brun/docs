*BPM* (Business Process Management) allow the execution of complex business process by automating a flow of workflow execution.

== Overview

The integrated BPM engine can be accessed by clicking the "Automation" link in the left menu. 

You need to select a subtenant to see the list of BPM that can be executed for a specific subtenant. BPM definition and instances work in a similar way as for workflows: you first need to associate a BPM to a subtenant and then each execution of a BPM will create a new instance that can be managed.

Use the "i" (information icon) to open a BPM instance and view it's detailed status.

A BM instance can be deleted with the "trash" icon.

With the execution breakpoints the execution of a BPM can be paused until the user manually resume the execution

It can be used to execute complex BPM with several part and allow for manual validation of each intermediate steps.

When a BPM execution is paused, the instance will be listed with an empty execution end date.

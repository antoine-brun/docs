The integrated BPM engine can be accessed by clicking the "Automation" link in the left menu. 

You need to select a subtenant to see the list of BPM that can be executed for a specific subtenant. BPM definition and instances work in a similar way as for workflows where you first need to associate a BPM to a subtenant and then each execution of a BPM will create in instance that you can manage.

Some instance may not have an end time set, this is because either the BPM is still executing or the BPM execution is paused by a user breakpoint. 

Use the "i" (information icon) to open a BPM instance and view it's detailed status.

A BM instance can be deleted with the "trash" icon.

== Execution breakpoint

With the execution breakpoints the execution of a BPM can be paused until the user manually resume the execution

It can be used to execute complex BPM with several part and allow for manual validation of each intermediate steps.

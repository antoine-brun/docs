The {product_name} is a platform for designing and developing network and security automation applications.

The community applications (Microservices, Workflows and Adaptors) are available on https://github.com/openmsa[GitHub]

These applications are located in dedicated GitHub repositories and can be forked and/or cloned from GitHub to your {product_name} development platform.

This page explains in detail how to do this and the associated best practices.

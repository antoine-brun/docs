The {product_name} integrate both Elasticsearch and Kibana to provide log analysis and event visualization.

== Overview

To visualize the events stored in Elasticsearch, you can use some of the dashaboard that are packaged in the {product_name}, but you can also design your own dashboards.

== Create a dashboard

To create a dashboard, you can either reuse on of the existing visualization provided in the {product_name} or you can create your own.

Let's create a simple visualization to show in a histogram the number of events collected and indexed in ubilogs-* in Elasticsearch.

=== Create a visualization

Open Kibana on http://MSA_IP:5601 and select "Visualize" on the left menu.

Click on "+ Create new visualization", select "Vertical Bar" and choose ubilogs-* as the source.

In the configuration panel, select "X-Axis" as the bucket type and "Date Histogram" for the aggregation. The field for aggregation should be automatically set to "Date".

Click on the button "Apply Change" on the top right of the panel.

On the same dashboard, add another predefined visualization named "timeFilter". This will add a simple time range selector widget to your dashboard.

==== Set the subtenant filter

The dashboard is meant to be deployed for a subtenant by the workflow "Deploy Dashboard", the workflow will inject the subtenant ID in the dashboard. For this to happen you have to add a filter "customer_id:0" to your dashboard.

==== Update the reference and name of the dashboard

By default Kibana saves the dashboard with a UID to identify it but here is how to update your dashbaord and give it a human readable name that you can use in the deployment workflow.

Step 1: export the dashboard

From Kibana management, go to "Saved Objects" and select your dashboard, export is as an ndjson file. Leave the option "Include related object" off.

Step 2: edit the ndjson file

With your favorite text editor, edit the file and update the properties "title" and "id". Both properties should be set to the same value starting with "template_".

.Example
----
"id":"template_my_dashboard"
"title":"template_my_dashboard"
----

Step 3: import the dashboard

Step 4: deploy the dashboard with the selected name

On the {product_name} UI, select your subtenant, make sure the workflow "Deploy Dashboard" is attached and click "+ Create Dashboard".

Set the template name to name you used in the ndjson file and provide a name of your choice for the Dashboard.

Execute the process and use the URL provided in the process execution status to open your custom dashboard.

NOTE: you need to edit the URL to use the proper IP address of your {product_name}

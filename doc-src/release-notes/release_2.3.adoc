==== Decision gateway

Allow your BPM process to take smart decisions based on the result of executed workflow and control the overall flow of the business process execution.

==== Parallel gateway

In a complex business process, very often activities can be carried out in parallel and one activity may depend on others. To address this, you can use parallel gateway.

==== User breakpoint

Some activity may require a human action to be carried out, like verifying the current state of the infrastructure being updated. Is is also possible that during the design phase of your BPM process you need to set some breakpoint to understand how your workflows are behaving and to debug then.

You can use the user breakpoint for that.

==== Reusability and execution management

BPM management is now similar to workflow and microservice management: design one, associate it to subtenants and run it from a subtenant.

Each BPM execution creates a new BPM instance that you can manage separately.

=== Microservices

The microservice designer now provides a new set of variable type such as

- Composite: advanced dynamic UI rendering with variable type composite: allow some dynamic end user form rendering at runtime.
- Password: auto-renders as a password web form input field.
- Link: auto-renders as a URL.

=== DevOps

=== Assurance

==== Monitoring Profile

The {product_name} provides a complete suite of assurance module from KPI monitoring to alarm management and dashboards. Closed loop assurance is possible as every components of the {product_name} are fully integrated. You can easily do the following:
 
- Configure and monitor your custom KPI with threshold crossing based alarms.
- Design and display your own monitoring graphs and decide what you want your end users to see in their homepage dashboards.
- Collect SNMP traps from your managed entities
- Collect network events such as syslogs, netflow traffic.
- Configure alarm based on your KPIs and/or events and sent email notification , SNMP traps or even execute workflow processes to automate remediation.

==== Integrated Kibana dashboards

link:https://www.elastic.co/kibana[Kibana] is now included in the {product_name}. Kibana is a free and open user interface that lets you visualize your Elasticsearch data and navigate the Elastic Stack.

Design your Kibana visualization and dashbaord to provide comprehensive view over your infrastructure event and data flow.

Deploy your dashboards or the ones from the {product_name} packaged library and provide subtenant level view to your users.

== CoreEngine

No changes have been made to the core engine from previous versions of the product. This allows consistency from branches of OpenMSA (community version), found on GitHub: https://github.com/openmsa

== Upgrading

Instructions to upgrade available in the quickstart guide.

=== Specific instruction for upgrating from {revnumber-prev} to {revnumber}

Starting from version 2.2.0, the quickstart provides an upgrade script `upgrade.sh` for taking care of possible actions such as recreating some volume, executing some database specific updates,...

Let's say that you are running {product_name} version {revnumber-prev}, to upgrade to the version {revnumber}, you need to follow these steps:

1. `$ cd quickstart`
2. `$ git checkout master`
3. `$ git pull`
4. `$ git checkout tags/{revnumber} -b {revnumber}`
5. `$ ./scripts/upgrade.sh`
